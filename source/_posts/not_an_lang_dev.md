You are not a "Java Developer".  
You are a Software Developer, which knows to write software in Java.

You don't want to hire "Java Developers".
You want to hire devs that have the ability to learn Java quickly, and write high quality sofware using it.

Java, or any other language for that matter, is just syntax. Learning a language is a long process, which consists of:
- Understanding how to write good software with it
- Understanding How the language works under the hood
- Understanding What are the language's limitations
- Understanding which problems are good to solve with it, and more importantly - which aren't.
- Learning the eco-system: libraries, tooling, etc' 

**I can't stress that enough.**

The language does not define you. What does?

- Your ability to make the right architecuals decisions
- Your ability to take responsibility for your work
- Your ability to grasp new ideas
- Your ability to learn new langauges & technologies quickly
- Your passion for software crafstmanship & understanding that you have to constantly learn in order to be good at it.

You don't want to be a "Java Developer", because, IMO, that means that:

1. You have only one tool in your toolbox which you use to solve every problem.
2. You're not a problem solver, but a code monkey.

You want to learn new langagues, new tools, new operation systems.  
Each one teaches you new techniques. new ways to reason about problems & new ways to solve them.

Java is very good language for a given set of problems. It's a very bad language for others. Furthermore, Java has it's own view on how to solve problems. Haskell solves problems in a completely different way.

Also, you don't want to hire people that call themselves "Java Developers" for these exact reasons. You don't want to hire "Java Server Team Leaders" as well.

These people look at (and reason about) problems from the wrong angle.
Instead of having a problem and looking for the right tool to solve it, They use the tools they feel comfortable with in order to solve it.
