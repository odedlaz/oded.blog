I'm a reddit addict, & regularly follow [/r/python](http://www.reddit.com/r/python).
A few years ago I came across a post called "Must-watch videos about Python", and I've been following [pymust.watch](http://pymust.watch) ever since.

The list is well balanced, and covers many important topics.
If you feel that a specific topic is missing, send a pull request to the websites [GitHub repository](https://github.com/s16h/py-must-watch).

Overwhelmed by the length of the list? go through my favorites first:
 
- [The Mighty Dictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Kc8xzcA68)
- [Inside the Python GIL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph374fJqFPE)
- [Stop Writing Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=o9pEzgHorH0)
- [Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go)
- [What Is Async, How Does It Work, And When Should I Use It?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WV7juNmyE8)
- [Garbage Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHVs_HkjdmI) - This one was really eye opening. After seeing it, I started looking into [PyPy](https://pypy.org/), [RPython](https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
