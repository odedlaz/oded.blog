I just read [Professor Beekums's](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=PBeekums) [Software Developers Should Have Sysadmin Experience](http://blog.professorbeekums.com/2017/01/software-developers-should-have.html) blog post, and loved it. 

I actually believe that in order to be a great developer, one <span style="text-decoration:underline;">**must**</span> know how to tweak, hack and fix the platform He's working on.

When I was in the army, I encountered manydevelopers that only knew how to open Visual Studio. Once they had issues with a specific installation, hardware or an app - they had no idea what to do.

I think it's fundamental to know how to fix broken installations & replace hardware parts, feel comfortable with the command line & writesscripts that automate work.

Don't underestimate or patronize the sysadmin (which often happens) - learn from them. They probably knows a few tricks that would significantly boost your productivity.
