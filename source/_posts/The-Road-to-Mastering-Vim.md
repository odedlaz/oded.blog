I spend most of my day (and nights) thinking, writing & editing code.  
 I dare to say - more than most programmers I know.

I started writing code in Pascal using **Turbo Pascal**, then C with **Turbo C**.  
 Then I moved to writing C# with **Visual Studio,** and were amazed by this incredible IDE.

After a few years of writing mostly C#, I shfted.  
 I moved to Linux, and started writing code in java and python.  
 I was so used to IDE's that **PyCharm** and **IntelliJ** were the only viable options.

But I wasn't satisfied, and those IDE's felt so heavy.  
 Then came across **Sublime Text** & **Atom** and shifted my focus to Atom.

I've been a heavy Atom user for a while now.  
 But I find myself again and again spending more of my time on the terminal.  
 And what do I do there? I edit things. Mostly on remote machines, using vim.

My knowledge of vim is very limited, and so is my productivity.  
 So my New Year's resolution is to master vim!

To do so I decided to remove my beloved atom, and shift ALL my focus to vim.
