PyMOTW is a series of articles written by [Doug Hellmann](https://doughellmann.com/blog/) to demonstrate how to use the modules of the Python standard library. 

The original series was dedicated to Python 2.x, and can be found [here](https://pymotw.com/2). The new series is dedicated to Python 3.x, and can be found [here](https://pymotw.com/2).

Both are updated regularly, and provide useful, short examples.
