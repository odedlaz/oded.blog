I just started using python seriously, and every time I have a question, my go to guy is [Jeff Knupp](https://www.jeffknupp.com/about-me). He's incredible.

I bought his book, [Writing Idiomic Python](https://www.jeffknupp.com/writing-idiomatic-python-ebook) a few days ago and I hope it'll help the transition from C# to python to be as smooth as possible.

Anyway, [Here's an excellent article](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/ "Improve Your Python: 'yield' and Generators Explained by Jeff Knupp")Â by Jeff that explains how python generators work.
