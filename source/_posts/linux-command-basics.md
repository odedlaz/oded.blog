At my previous workplace I spent 90% of my time writing server side .Net code, on Windows (no [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page)). At my current workplace I shifted to a linux only environment.

Linux is an old buddy, but It was always a fling, not a serious relationship. 

It took me a while to adjust to working on linux every day, and finding out that now the terminal is my best friend, as opposed to GUI in windows.

*linux command line basics* series really helped me get started: [part one](http://www.techspot.com/guides/835-linux-command-line-basics/), [part two](http://www.techspot.com/guides/844-linux-command-line-part-ii/).
