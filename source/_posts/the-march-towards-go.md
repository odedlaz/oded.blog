Have you heard about the [go](https://golang.org) programming language?
I just read [The March Towards Go](http://zef.me/6191/the-march-towards-go) and got extremely interested. 

Here's what go's creators, [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike) & [Ken Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson), said about it:

```
Go attempts to combine the development speed of working in a dynamic language like Python with the performance and safety of a compiled language like C or C++. In our experiments with Go to date, typical builds feel instantaneous; even large binaries compile in just a few seconds. And the compiled code runs close to the speed of C. Go is designed to let you move fast.

Weâ€™re hoping Go turns out to be a great language for systems programming with support for multi-processing and a fresh and lightweight take on object-oriented design, with some cool features like true closures and reflection.
