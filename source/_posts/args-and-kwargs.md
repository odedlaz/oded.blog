`*args` and `**kwargs` are a big deal in the python world, and to me, a bit magical:  
On one hand, they allow one to inject arbitrary arguments to functions, which is extremely powerful. 

On the other hand, if abused, can make your code extremely complex and unreadable.

I suggest reading  [args and kwargs](http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/) to understand how they work in depth.
