I had a fun time playing with exec / eval in the last few hours. Itâ€™s pretty awesome that you can read code from a file, [load it into a module and execute it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5362771/load-module-from-string-in-python). you can use eval to evaluate an expression or exec to evaluate a statement. if youâ€™re wondering whats the difference really, [read this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2220699/whats-the-difference-between-eval-exec-and-compile-in-python). just make sure you [understand what youâ€™re doing](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/2/1/exec-in-python/).Â
