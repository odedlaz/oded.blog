Hey There! Pleased to e-meet you!
 
I'm *Oded*, A professional programmer, blogger, teacher assistant, personal tutor, geek.


Programming started as a hobby. I got my first PC when I turned seven years old and got hooked right away. I ***LOVE*** technology, writing code & solving interesting problems.
  
I started my professional career at *Unit 8200*, the Israeli equivalent of the American *National Security Agency*. after six years of working for the intelligence community, I moved to the private sector. 

Now I'm living the dream - Spending my days on doing what I love, and getting paid to do it :)

Feel free to contact me regarding speaking engagements, tutoring, or anything else.
