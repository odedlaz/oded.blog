Here you can find a variety of public cryptographic keys that you can use to verify digital signatures on code or content I have signed.

You can also verify my online identities on [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/odedlaz).


### OpenPGP

[OpenPGP](http://openpgp.org/) is a non-proprietary protocol for encrypting email communication using public key cryptography. It is based on the original PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software. The OpenPGP protocol defines standard formats for encrypted messages, signatures, and certificates for exchanging public keys.

[GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) is a complete and free implementation of the [OpenPGP](http://openpgp.org/) standard as defined by [RFC4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) (also known as PGP). [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) allows to encrypt and sign your data and communication, features a versatile key management system as well as access modules for all kinds of public key directories.
